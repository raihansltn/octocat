# Hello There, I'm Raihan!
#### An undergraduate Computer Science student at Universitas Ary Ginanjar. Iâ€™m a dedicated Security practitioner and Junior Researcher with a passion for exploring diverse and impactful fields. In short, my research interests are to discover and understand critical security issues, and then to design and develop innovative solutions to address these issues.

I'm currently doing research for AIRDU Research Group of Universitas Ary Ginanjar, and some small research projects in my personal lab.

To be precise, my research areas and interests:

- Privacy Compliance and Enforcement
- Secure ML Systems
- Cyber Threat Intelligence
- NLP/ML-assisted Anomaly Detection and Vulnerability Discovery
- side-channel attacks on wireless networks
- log and traffic analysis for attack detection and threat intelligence
- DDoS mitigation using SDN
- firmware security and reverse engineering
- anti-forensic technique and mitigation

My work itself, spans across cybersecurity, where I specialize in uncovering and analyzing security flaws and bugs to strengthen systems against vulnerabilities. In addition, I delve deeply into the realms of artificial intelligence and machine learning, aiming to unlock innovative applications and refine existing methodologies.
